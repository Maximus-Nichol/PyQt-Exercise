# PyQt-Exercise
Small Python GUI exercise - BE-CSS-GTA-2025-83-GRAE

This exercise asks the following:
1. A combobox which presents a list of countries using "https://www.apicountries.com/countries" -- line 113
2. A label which changes based on the selection -- line 100
3. (bonus) Parse JSON in a background thread -- line 70
4. (bonus) Add an argument to preselect a country -- line 136

I used PyQt5 and handled threading with QThread. The bulk of my code is found in 'country_picker.py' and you can find my test
case in 'testcase1_call_country_data.py'.

For easy access you can go to the lines mentioned above to find the correlating task completed.
